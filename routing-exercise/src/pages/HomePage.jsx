            <h1>Welcome to the Cosmic Encyclopedia</h1>
            <p>Buried in the folds of spacetime, beyond nebulae and collapsing stars, there exists a tome unlike any other—the Cosmic Encyclopedia. It is not bound in paper or ink, but in the vibrating strings of reality itself. Each page is a galaxy, each paragraph a constellation, each letter a particle humming with ancient knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Encyclopedia is said to contain the total sum of all truths—known, unknown, forgotten, and yet to be discovered. It speaks of the birth of stars, the language of black holes, the dreams of planets, and the mathematics of multiverses. It knows the songs sung by quasars and the secrets hidden inside dark matter.</p>
            <p>Few have glimpsed its chapters. Fewer still can comprehend its dialect: a shifting mosaic of logic, light, gravity, and memory. Scholars from a thousand civilizations have searched for it, while others claim it exists not in a place, but in the act of asking—the universe answering itself, one question at a time.</p>
            <p>To read the Cosmic Encyclopedia is not merely to know the cosmos—it is to become part of it.</p>
